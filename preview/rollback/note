Where: This applied broadly across our application wherever we used the standard pattern for getting a database session, either through Depends(get_db_session) in our API route functions or using async with AsyncSessionLocal() as session:.
How it works: The database session provided by Depends or the async with block manages a transaction. If any Python exception occurred before await db.commit() was successfully called within that function or block, the session manager would automatically ensure the database transaction was rolled back when the function exited due to the error. This prevented partially completed database operations from being saved. This covered functions like register_user, login_user, schedule_appointment, analyze_symptoms, add_health_record, add_doctor_note, etc., in their original forms regarding errors before the commit point.
